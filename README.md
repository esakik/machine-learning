![DALL·E 2024-02-08 18 09 28 - Create a wide-format, detailed illustration that visualizes _The nuts and bolts of machine learning_ without including any characters or letters  This](https://github.com/esakik/machine-learning-nutsnbolts/assets/44774033/845c0482-d8e6-41c1-8d10-827289af28c8)

This repository aims to organize implementations of machine learning algorithms and demonstrate practical ways to apply or use machine learning models.
I initiated this project to refresh and reinforce my fading knowledge of previously learned concepts, deepen my understanding of various algorithms, and examine examples of their practical applications.

## Algorithms

Here is an overview of machine learning algorithms that are either currently implemented or planned for future implementation.
Additionally, this table presents supplementary materials I have prepared to revisit and strengthen my understanding of what I learned.

### Prerequisites

To experiment with the examples, you will need to follow these installation and setup procedures:

| Library          | Setup Instructions             |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Pyenv            | https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv |
| Poetry           | https://python-poetry.org/docs |

#### Configuration of the Python version

Ensure that this version aligns with the version used in Poetry, then choose the appropriate version:

```shell
$ pyenv install 3.9
$ pyenv local 3.9
```

#### Install the required dependencies

The minor version depends on the version of the Python you have installed:

```shell
$ poetry env use ~/.pyenv/versions/3.9.17/bin/python3.9
$ poetry install
```
